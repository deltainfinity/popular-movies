# popular-movies
An Android application for displaying information about popular movies from The Movie Database (TMDB).

The API key for this application is contained in a Java class called TMDBApiKey. The class contains a single public static method called getApiKey() that returns a String containing the API key. THIS CLASS IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS REPOSITORY! You will need to create the TMDBApiKey class, add your own TMDB API key, and implement the getApiKey() method in order to run this application.
